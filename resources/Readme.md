## Design principles
- Used grid for the layout of the main image-text block on each page header.
- Use of flex-boxes for every other paragraph to adjust the text and images. Added classes to shift the images and text positioning from one side to the other.
- Applied the aspect-ratio property to avoid CLS by reserving the place for images while they load.
- Added a dynamical line-height to manage the whitespace on different browser resolutions.
- Shared css-styles through a main reusable styles file.
- Additional form-specific styling was applied through an additional css file.

## Accessibility strategies
- Added alt properties to all images.
- Used colors from opposite ends of the spectrum to help with color-blinded compatibility.

## SEO strategies
- Use of a brief and descriptive title tag.
- Added a meta description tag to the main page.
- Kept paragraphs short enough for the search engines to process them easily.
- Added alt properties to all images.
